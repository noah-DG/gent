\title{Gene-based test statistic correlations (Admixed American 1000 Genomes Phase 3)}
\format{
This dataset is a list where each element is a matrix of correlations between gene-based test statistics due to LD between SNPs in gene-specific sets. Rows/columns of these matrices are named by the HGNC symbol of the gene to which the row/column corresponds. Rows/columns are ordered by within-chromosome base pair location of the transcription start site of each gene in hg19 coordinates.

\description{
Each entry in this list is a chromosome-specific matrix of correlations between GenT test statistics under the gene-based null hypothesis (-+/50Kb SNP-gene assignment).
