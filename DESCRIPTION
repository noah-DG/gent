Description: This package provides functionality to perform gene-based association testing using GWAS summary statistics and a test which has a guaranteed null distribution, separating it from other gene-based association tests. We also introduce a gene-based test which can integrate xQTL information and provide causal inference under the assumptions of Mendelian Randomization and a set of multi-ancestry gene-based association and between-population comparison tests.
